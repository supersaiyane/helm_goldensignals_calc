# SRE Architect Roadmap

Follow this comprehensive, end-to-end roadmap‚Äîspanning foundational skills through world-class architectural mastery‚Äîto help you level up from SRE practitioner to top-notch SRE Architect.

---

## üöÄ Phase 1: Foundation (0‚Äì3 months)

### 1. Software & Systems Fundamentals
- **Operating Systems**: Deep dive into Linux internals (process lifecycle, I/O, kernel tuning).
- **Networking**: TCP/IP stack, HTTP(S), DNS, load balancing, network troubleshooting tools (tcpdump, Wireshark).
- **Programming & Scripting**: Master one systems language (Go, Rust, or Python) and Bash scripting for automation.

### 2. Cloud & Virtualization
- **Compute**: EC2, Azure VMs, GCE; container runtimes (Docker).
- **Networking**: VPC/VNet, subnets, security groups, route tables.
- **Storage**: EBS/EFS/S3 (or equivalents), block vs. object storage differences.

### 3. Configuration & Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform** (or CloudFormation/ARM/Bicep): write, modularize, test, and version your IaC.
- **Ansible** (or similar CM tools): idempotent configuration management and orchestration.

---

## üéØ Phase 2: Core SRE Principles (3‚Äì6 months)

### 1. Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) & Error Budgets
- **SLIs**: Define measurable indicators (latency, availability, throughput).
- **SLO Targets**: Set realistic targets (e.g., 99.9%, 99.99%) balancing reliability vs. velocity.
- **Error Budget**: Calculate (1 ‚Äì SLO) √ó time; use ‚Äúburn rate‚Äù alerts (6√ó, 14√ó windows) to throttle releases or trigger postmortems.

### 2. Observability & Monitoring
- **Metrics**: Prometheus (counters, gauges, histograms), Grafana dashboards.
- **Logging**: ELK/EFK stack, structured logging, log rotation and retention policies.
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry, distributed context propagation, span analysis.
- **Alerting**: Alertmanager, PagerDuty/webhooks, on-call best practices and escalation.

### 3. Incident Management & Toil Reduction
- **Runbooks**: Clear, executable playbooks for common incident types.
- **Postmortems**: Blameless, focused on corrective action and prevention.
- **Automation**: Auto-remediation playbooks to eliminate repetitive toil (e.g., restarting failed services).

### 4. Capacity Planning & Performance
- **Forecasting**: Growth projections, resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O).
- **Autoscaling**: HPA, Cluster-Autoscaler, custom metrics-driven scaling.
- **Load Testing**: k6, JMeter; performance profiling and bottleneck identification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 3: Advanced Reliability Engineering (6‚Äì12 months)

### 1. Resilience & Chaos Engineering
- Design and run chaos experiments (Chaos Toolkit, LitmusChaos).
- Hypothesize failure modes, design blast radii, measure SLO impact.

### 2. Distributed Systems Architecture
- Patterns: circuit breakers, bulkheads, backpressure, retries with jitter.
- Data models: message queues, event sourcing, eventual consistency trade‚Äëoffs.

### 3. Multi-Region & Global Scale
- Active-active vs. active-passive designs.
- Global DNS with latency-based routing (Route¬†53, Traffic Manager).
- Data replication (Cassandra, DynamoDB Global Tables, Cloud Spanner).

### 4. Security & Compliance
- Zero-trust networking, identity federation (OIDC, SAML).
- Secrets management (Vault, AWS KMS), supply-chain security (SBOMs).
- Regulatory frameworks: PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR readiness.

### 5. Cost Optimization & FinOps
- Rightsizing, spot/preemptible instances, savings plans/committed use discounts.
- FinOps culture: tagging strategy, chargeback/showback, budget alerts.

---

## üéì Phase 4: Architecting at Scale (12+ months)

### 1. Design Frameworks & Governance
- Establish SRE playbooks and reliability design reviews (RDRs).
- Form reliability guilds, SLO review boards, and cross-team error budget policies.

### 2. Platform Thinking
- Build internal PaaS: expose self-service reliability primitives.
- Provide standardized IaC modules, CI/CD pipelines, and golden-signal dashboards.

### 3. Advanced Observability Platforms
- Integrate real-user monitoring (RUM) and synthetic checks.
- Implement ML-driven anomaly detection and custom observability data lakes.

### 4. Executive Communication & Leadership
- Translate reliability metrics into business KPIs (e.g., uptime ‚Üí revenue impact).
- Lead blameless postmortems with stakeholders and craft quarterly SRE objectives.
