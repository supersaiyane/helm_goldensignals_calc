# DevOps Engineer Roadmap

This comprehensive, end-to-end roadmap‚Äîcovering foundational skills through enterprise-scale mastery‚Äîwill guide you from an aspiring DevOps Engineer to a strategic DevOps Architect.

---

## üöÄ Phase 1: Foundation (0‚Äì3 months)

### 1. Systems & Scripting Fundamentals
- **Operating Systems**: Linux basics (process management, filesystem, permissions).
- **Networking**: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S, SSH; troubleshooting with `netstat`, `tcpdump`.
- **Programming & Scripting**: Python or Go fundamentals; Bash/Zsh for automation scripts.

### 2. Version Control & Collaboration
- **Git Mastery**: branching strategies (Git Flow, trunk-based), pull requests, rebasing.
- **Collaboration Workflows**: GitHub/GitLab CI integration, code reviews, issue tracking.

### 3. Containerization & Build Tools
- **Docker**: creating and optimizing images, multi-stage builds, registries.
- **Build Tools**: Maven/Gradle (Java), npm/Yarn (Node.js), Makefiles for CI tasks.

---

## üéØ Phase 2: Core DevOps Practices (3‚Äì6 months)

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
- **CI Servers**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI.
- **Pipeline Patterns**: linting, unit/integration testing, code coverage, artifact storage.
- **Build Artifact Management**: Nexus, Artifactory, container registries.

### 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Terraform** / CloudFormation / Pulumi: writing modular, testable, versioned IaC.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for infrastructure provisioning.

### 3. Continuous Delivery & Deployment (CD)
- **Deployment Strategies**: blue-green, canary, rolling updates.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes basics (deployments, services, CRDs) and Helm charts.
- **GitOps**: Flux or Argo CD for declarative delivery.

### 4. Monitoring & Logging
- **Metrics**: Prometheus, Grafana dashboards, alerting rules.
- **Logging**: EFK/ELK stacks, centralized log aggregation, log parsing.
- **Tracing & APM**: Jaeger, Zipkin, or commercial tools (New Relic, DataDog).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 3: Advanced DevOps Engineering (6‚Äì12 months)

### 1. Security & Compliance (DevSecOps)
- **Secrets Management**: Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Key Encryption.
- **Static & Dynamic Scans**: SAST (SonarQube), DAST (OWASP ZAP), container image scanning.
- **Policy as Code**: OPA/Gatekeeper, Terraform Sentinel.

### 2. Scalability & Resilience
- **Auto-Scaling**: Kubernetes HPA, Cluster-Autoscaler, custom metrics.
- **Resilience Testing**: chaos engineering with Chaos Toolkit or LitmusChaos.
- **Performance Testing**: JMeter, k6; identify bottlenecks, benchmark SLIs.

### 3. Cloud & Multi-Cloud Deployments
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure, GCP core services (compute, networking, storage).
- **Multi-Cloud Strategies**: Crossplane or Terraform Cloud for abstractions.
- **Hybrid Architectures**: VPN/Direct Connect, Consistent networking, identity federation.

### 4. Collaboration & Culture
- **DevOps Mindset**: shared responsibility, feedback loops, blameless culture.
- **Documentation & Runbooks**: maintainable runbooks, standard operating procedures.
- **Metrics & KPIs**: lead time for changes, deployment frequency, MTTR, change failure rate.

## üéì Phase 4: DevOps Architect at Scale (12+ months)

### 1. Platform & Toolchain Design
- **Internal Tooling**: build self-service CI/CD platforms, developer portals.
- **Extensible Pipelines**: plugin architectures, SDKs, unified dashboards.
- **Service Catalogs**: central registry for microservices and APIs.

### 2. Governance & Compliance at Enterprise
- **Policy Enforcement**: guardrails with policy-as-code, audit trails.
- **Cost Management**: tagging strategies, FinOps integration, budget automation.
- **Identity & Access Management**: SSO, RBAC/ABAC, secret rotation policies.

### 3. Strategic Leadership & Roadmapping
- **Reliability Reviews**: SLO governance, error-budget policies, reliability design reviews.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: establish DevOps guilds or chapters.
- **Business Alignment**: translate technical metrics into business outcomes, ROI on DevOps initiatives.

### 4. Continuous Improvement & Innovation
- **Emerging Technologies**: GitOps 2.0, service meshes (Istio, Linkerd), serverless frameworks.
- **AI/ML in DevOps**: automated anomaly detection, predictive scaling.
- **Community Engagement**: open-source contributions, conference talks, internal hackathons.

### Certifications (optional)
- AWS Certified DevOps Engineer ‚Äì Professional  
- Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)  
- HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate  

### Hands-On Projects
1. **End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline**: Build pipelines for a microservice with lint, test, build, deploy stages across dev/stage/prod.  
2. **GitOps Deployment**: Implement a fully declarative GitOps flow using Argo CD across multiple clusters.  
3. **Secured DevSecOps Pipeline**: Integrate SAST, DAST, and policy-as-code into your CI/CD workflow.
