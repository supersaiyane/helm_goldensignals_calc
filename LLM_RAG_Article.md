## 1️⃣  The Question That Sparked the Journey

Like a lot of tech folks, I’ve been fascinated by large‑language models (LLMs) but wary of shipping my private data to the cloud. I wanted three things:

1. **Answers that cite my own documents** (not just the public web).  
2. **Full privacy** — no payloads heading to an API endpoint I don’t control.  
3. **Zero ongoing cost** (my GPU already sits idle half the day!).

That led me to **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)**: let a small local model *retrieve* the most relevant snippets from my files, then *generate* an answer grounded in those snippets.

---

## 2️⃣  Why RAG Beats “Just Use the LLM”

| Plain LLM | RAG‑Enhanced LLM |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Answers can hallucinate or be **outdated** | Every answer is backed by *verbatim chunks* of your docs |
| Needs fine‑tuning to learn private data → $$ | **No re‑training**; indexing is quick and cheap |
| Hard to show your work | Citations come for free |

RAG is basically the **open‑book exam** version of question‑answering.

## 3️⃣  The Stack (All Local, All Free)

| Layer | Tool | Why I picked it |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **LLM** | `llama3:8b-q4_K_M` via **Ollama** | Open‑weight, 4‑bit quantised → runs on CPU or modest GPU |
| **Embeddings** | `nomic-embed-text` | Tiny 137 M model but robust semantic recall |
| **Vector store** | **ChromaDB** | Zero‑config, file‑backed, perfect for desktop |
| **Orchestration** | **LlamaIndex** | Batteries‑included loaders & evaluators |
| **API** | **FastAPI** | One‑file micro‑service |

## 4️⃣  How It Works — 30 Seconds

1. **Ingest** – `rag_build.py` walks `./my_docs`, splits each file into ~512‑token chunks, embeds them, and stores vectors in `chroma_db/`.  
2. **Serve** – `rag_query.py` spins up FastAPI. → *Query → top‑k chunks → prompt → answer + citations.*  
3. **Iterate** – Drop new files into `my_docs/`, rerun the build script, and your assistant gets smarter.

*⏱ Latency:* ~250 ms on an RTX 3060 or ~2 s on a modern laptop CPU.

## 5️⃣  Ship It in Five Commands 🚢

```bash
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh     # install runtime
ollama pull llama3:8b-q4_K_M              # chat model
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest       # embedding model
git clone https://github.com/…/local-llm-rag.git
cd local-llm-rag && python rag_build.py && python rag_query.py
```

**Test it**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -d '{"question":"Summarise my 2023 tax return"}'
```

## 6️⃣  Lessons Learned on the Road 🛣️

* **Quantisation is magic.** Going from FP16 to Q4 slashed VRAM by ~60 % with <3 % quality loss.  
* **Chunking strategy matters.** 20 % overlap avoided “lost context” at chunk boundaries.  
* **RAG ≠ silver bullet.** Garbage‑in/garbage‑out still applies. I now tag my notes clearly so the retriever has good signals.  
* **Evaluators save time.** LlamaIndex’s retrieval‑recall metric quickly surfaced sub‑optimal embedding settings.

---

## 7️⃣  Where I’m Taking It Next

* **Cross‑encoder re‑ranking** (`bge-reranker-large`) for even tighter relevance.  
* **RAG‑Fusion** (BM25 + vectors) to blend keyword and semantic search.  
* **Multi‑modal retrieval** — CLIP embeddings so I can ask questions about images in my research folder.  
* A polished **Next.js chat UI** so it feels like first‑class ChatGPT.
